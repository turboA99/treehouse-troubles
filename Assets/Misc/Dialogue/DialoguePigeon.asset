  - 'Pigeon: Wha- No! Of course not!'
  - 'Me: Sorry, I just went through two scams in one day. I''m tired.'
  - 'Pigeon: Well! I''m sorry about that! '
  - 'Pigeon: But I can assure you this is no scam!'
  - 'Pigeon: This is a genuine offer. I made sure the pictures would look correct!'
  - 'Pigeon: It''s a bit small... But I bet it''s just what you need as a student!'
  - 'Me: Well, it''s definitely more expensive than the previous houses...'
  - 'Me: But at the same time those weren''t real offers.'
  - 'Me: And I... kind of couldn''t find anything else that''s available.'
  - 'Me: Sure, why don''t you show me around. It better be cozy!'
  - 'Me: I need a good rest after all this crazyness.'
